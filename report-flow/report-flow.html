If you don’t, you won't. Responsibilities like work and caregiving may present time challenges, but spending more time on these activities, especially the ones that you don’t do now, can make a difference in your quality of life.</p>

Be alert to opportunities to help family members, friends, or neighbors in need. Also consider volunteering at a helping program in your community. Contributing to the wellbeing of others is key to a fulfilling life and fosters a sense of purpose and community, and you will find that you gain as much from the experience as the people you help. Our recommendation: Spend at least four hours per week helping others.</p>
